# Flutter tests utils

Provide some utils functions when you write tests with Flutter.

The features are :

- ðŸš€ Generate `toString`, `copyWith`, `constructor` and Equatable (`props`) methods
- ðŸš€ Implement JsonSerializable methods
- ðŸš€ Open the test file related to the source code opened
- ðŸš€ Create a test file directly with a button
- ðŸš€ Support mono repo and multi packages repo
- ðŸš€ If you made a typo when creating a test file, the plugin will made some suggestions, it will find the closests test file related to your source file
- ðŸš€ View the number of tests for your classes and functions directly in the editor
- ðŸš€ Synchronise test files with source files. Automatically rename and move test files when the source changes

## Demo

### Create a test file

### Open test file

## Features

| Command          | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open test file   | Open the test file related to the source file opened. Ask to create one if it do not exists |
| Open source file | Open the source file related to the test file opened                                        |

## How it works

To be detected, your test files must be placed inside the `test` folder with the same folder structure as the source files.
For example, the test file of `lib/folder_a/todo.dart` must be `test/folder_a/todo_test.dart`.
