- ðŸš€ Open the test file related to the source code opened
- ðŸš€ Create a test file directly with a button
- ðŸš€ If you made a type when creating a test file, the plugin will made some suggestions, it will find the closests test file related to your source file

## Demo 

### Create a test file
![rename](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdrienAudouard/flutter-utils/main/readme-images/create_test_file.gif)

### Open test file
![go](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdrienAudouard/flutter-utils/main/readme-images/go.gif)

## Features

| Command | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Open test file | Open the test file related to the source file opened. Ask to create one if it do not exists|
| Open source file | Open the source file related to the test file opened |

## How it works

To be detected, your test files must be placed inside the `test` folder with the same folder structure as the source files.
For example, the test file of `lib/folder_a/todo.dart` must be `test/folder_a/todo_test.dart`.

## Settings

| Settings | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `flutter-utils.testFileFolder` | Folder under `/test` where your tests are located|
| `flutter-utils.closestFileMinPercentage` | When the test file is not found, the extension will made some suggestions by searching the closest search test files with a score above this settings (0.8 by default) |
|`flutter-utils.suggestions.renameTestFile`| Enable test file rename suggestion. When no test file are found for the file opened, the extension will try to find test files that might match and will ask you if you want to rename it with the correct name.|
| `flutter-utils.codeLens.enabled` | Enable or not the code lens feature |
| `flutter-utils.codeLens.testFunctions` | Functions that should be considered as test functions (test, blocTest, testWidgets, patrolTest by default)
